# connectome-validation

To validate a built circuit model in terms of bouton density and synapses per connection, and - if required - update the s2f-recipe to improve these results.

Data to validate against can be found (for example for cortical circuits) under:
git@bbpgitlab.epfl.ch:conn/data-and-recipes/connectome-validation-data.git
